We will first intentionally crash our pod and see that Kubernetes will self-heal by immediately spinning it back up. Then we will trigger the health check by stopping the response on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/health</code> endpoint in our app. After three consecutive failures, Kubernetes should kill the pod and then recreate it.</p>

<p>It would be best to prepare by splitting your screen between the OpenShift Web UI and the OSToy application so that you can see the results of our actions immediately.</p>

<p>But if your screen is too small or that just won’t work, then open the OSToy application in another tab so you can quickly switch to the OpenShift console once you click the button. To get to this deployment in the OpenShift Web Console go to:</p>

<p><strong>Workloads -&gt; Deployments</strong> and select <strong>ostoy-frontend</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="media/managedlab/11-ostoy-deploynum.png" alt="Deploy Num" /></p>

<p>Go to the OSToy app, click on <em>Home</em> in the left menu, and enter a message in the “Crash Pod” tile (e.g. “This is goodbye!”) and press the “Crash Pod” button. This will cause the pod to crash and Kubernetes will restart the pod. After you press the button you will see:</p>

<p><img src="media/managedlab/12-ostoy-crashmsg.png" alt="Crash Message" /></p>

<p>Quickly switch to the Deployment screen. You will see that the pod is yellow meaning it is recovering the fallen pad and scaling back to 1. It should quickly come back up and show blue.</p>

<p>You can also check in the pod events and further verify that the container has crashed and been restarted.</p>

<p>Keep the page from the pod events still open from the previous step.  Then in the OSToy app click on the “Toggle Health” button, in the “Toggle Health Status” tile.  You will see the “Current Health” switch to “I’m not feeling all that well”.</p>

<p><img src="media/managedlab/15-ostoy-togglehealth.png" alt="Pod Events" /></p>

<p>This will cause the app to stop responding with a “200 HTTP code”. After 3 such consecutive failures, Kubernetes will kill the pod and restart it. Quickly switch back to the pod events tab and you will see that the liveness probe failed and the pod as being restarted.</p>
