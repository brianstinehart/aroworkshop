<p>You will need a personal GitHub account for todayâ€™s workshop. If you donâ€™t already have one, you can sign up for free <a href="https://github.com/join">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ssh-client">SSH Client</h4>
<p>You will also need a client to SSH into a jumphost for command line access. Linux and Mac systems tend to have one included, and one of the more popular clients for Windows is PuTTY that you can download <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">here</a>. More recently, Windows 10 offers OpenSSH that can be <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">installed as an optional feature</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the web interface, we will be running commands directly against our cluster using a jump host. The SSH client mentioned above will be used to establish an SSH session to that jump host, and the diagram below provides a visual of how this hangs together.</p>

<h4 id="ssh-session">SSH Session</h4>
<p>So our first step will be to SSH into the jump host. Details will be provided by the instructor providing the command to run and the required password.</p>

<p>It will look similar to this: <strong>ssh student01@3.104.30â€¦</strong></p>
