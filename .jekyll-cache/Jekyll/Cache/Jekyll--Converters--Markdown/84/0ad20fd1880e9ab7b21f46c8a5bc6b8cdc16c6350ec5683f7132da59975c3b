<p>It would be best to prepare by splitting your screen between the OpenShift Web UI and the OSToy application so that you can see the results of our actions immediately.</p>

<p>But if your screen is too small or that just wonâ€™t work, then open the OSToy application in another tab so you can quickly switch to the OpenShift console once you click the button. To get to this deployment in the OpenShift Web Console go to:</p>

<p><strong>Workloads -&gt; Deployments</strong> and select <strong>ostoy-frontend</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/media/managedlab/11-ostoy-deploynum.png" alt="Deploy Num" /></p>

<p>Go to the OSToy app, click on <em>Home</em> in the left menu, and enter a message in the â€œCrash Podâ€ tile (e.g. â€œThis is goodbye!â€) and press the â€œCrash Podâ€ button. This will cause the pod to crash and Kubernetes will restart the pod. After you press the button you will see:</p>

<p><img src="/media/managedlab/12-ostoy-crashmsg.png" alt="Crash Message" /></p>

<p>Quickly switch to the Deployment screen. You will see that the pod is yellow meaning it is recovering the fallen pad and scaling back to 1. It should quickly come back up and show blue.</p>

<p>You can also check in the pod events and further verify that the container has crashed and been restarted.</p>

<p>Keep the page from the pod events still open from the previous step.  Then in the OSToy app click on the â€œToggle Healthâ€ button, in the â€œToggle Health Statusâ€ tile.  You will see the â€œCurrent Healthâ€ switch to â€œIâ€™m not feeling all that wellâ€.</p>

<p><img src="/media/managedlab/15-ostoy-togglehealth.png" alt="Pod Events" /></p>

<p>This will cause the app to stop responding with a â€œ200 HTTP codeâ€. After 3 such consecutive failures, Kubernetes will kill the pod and restart it. Quickly switch back to the pod events tab and you will see that the liveness probe failed and the pod as being restarted.</p>
