I"Ø<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/openshift/">Azure Red Hat OpenShift</a> is a fully managed Red Hat OpenShift service in Azure that is jointly engineered and supported by Microsoft and Red Hat. In this lab, youâ€™ll go through a set of tasks that will help you understand some of the concepts of deploying and securing container based applications on top of Azure Red Hat OpenShift.</p>

<p>You can use this guide as an OpenShift tutorial and as study material to help you get started to learn OpenShift.</p>

<p>Some of the things youâ€™ll be going through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/dev_guide/projects.html">project</a> on the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console</li>
  <li>Deploying a MongoDB container that uses Azure Disks for <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html">persistent storage</a></li>
  <li>Restoring data into the MongoDB container by <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/dev_guide/executing_remote_commands.html">executing commands</a> on the Pod</li>
  <li>Deploying a Node JS API and frontend app from Git Hub using <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/creating_images/s2i.html">Source-To-Image (S2I)</a></li>
  <li>Exposing the web application frontend using <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/dev_guide/routes.html">Routes</a></li>
  <li>Creating a <a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy">network policy</a> to control communication between the different tiers in the application</li>
</ul>

<p>Youâ€™ll be doing the majority of the labs using the OpenShift CLI, but you can also accomplish them using the Azure Red Hat OpenShift web console.</p>
