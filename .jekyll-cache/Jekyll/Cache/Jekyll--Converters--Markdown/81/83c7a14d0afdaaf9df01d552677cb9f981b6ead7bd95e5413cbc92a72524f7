<p>Inside the OpenShift web UI click on <em>Storage</em> in the left menu. You will then see a list of all persistent volume claims that our application has made.  In this case there is just one called â€œostoy-pvcâ€.  You will also see other pertinent information such as whether it is bound or not, size, access mode and age.</p>

<p>In this case the mode is RWO (Read-Write-Once) which means that the volume can only be mounted to one node, but the pod(s) can both read and write to that volume.  The default in ARO is for Persistent Volumes to be backed by Azure Disk, but it is possible to chose Azure Files so that you can use the RWX (Read-Write-Many) access mode.  (<a href="https://docs.openshift.com/aro/architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#pv-access-modes">See here for more info on access modes</a>)</p>

<p>In the OSToy app click on <em>Persistent Storage</em> in the left menu.  In the â€œFilenameâ€ area enter a filename for the file you will create. (ie: â€œtest-pv.txtâ€)</p>

<p>Underneath that, in the â€œFile Contentsâ€ box, enter text to be stored in the file. (ie: â€œAzure Red Hat OpenShift is the greatest thing since sliced bread!â€ or â€œtestâ€ :) ).  Then click â€œCreate fileâ€.</p>

<p><img src="/media/managedlab/17-ostoy-createfile.png" alt="Create File" /></p>

<p>You will then see the file you created appear above under â€œExisting filesâ€.  Click on the file and you will see the filename and the contents you entered.</p>

<p><img src="/media/managedlab/18-ostoy-viewfile.png" alt="View File" /></p>

<p>We now want to kill the pod and ensure that the new pod that spins up will be able to see the file we created. Exactly like we did in the previous section. Click on <em>Home</em> in the left menu.</p>

<p>Click on the â€œCrash podâ€ button.  (You can enter a message if youâ€™d like).</p>

<p>Click on <em>Persistent Storage</em> in the left menu</p>

<p>You will see the file you created is still there and you can open it to view its contents to confirm.</p>

<p><img src="/media/managedlab/19-ostoy-existingfile.png" alt="Crash Message" /></p>

<p>Now letâ€™s confirm that itâ€™s actually there by using the CLI and checking if it is available to the container.  If you remember we mounted the directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/demo_files</code> to our PVC.  So get the name of your frontend pod</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oc get pods</code></p>

<p>then get an SSH session into the container</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oc rsh &lt;podname&gt;</code></p>

<p>then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd /var/demo_files</code></p>

<p>if you enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> you can see all the files you created.  Next, letâ€™s open the file we created and see the contents</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat test-pv.txt</code></p>

<p>You should see the text you entered in the UI.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ oc get pods
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

$ oc rsh ostoy-frontend-5fc8d486dc-wsw24
/ $ cd /var/demo_files/

/var/demo_files $ ls
lost+found   test-pv.txt

/var/demo_files $ cat test-pv.txt 
Azure Red Hat OpenShift is the greatest thing since sliced bread!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then exit the SSH session by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>. You will then be in your CLI.</p>
