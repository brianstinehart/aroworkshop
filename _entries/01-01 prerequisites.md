#### GitHub Account
You will need a personal GitHub account for today's workshop. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com/join).

#### SSH Client
You will also need a client to SSH into a jumphost for command line access. Linux and Mac systems tend to have one included, and one of the most popular clients for Windows is PuTTY that you can download [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

#### Lab Setup
Along with the web interface, we will be running commands directly against our cluster using a jump host. The SSH client mentioned above will be used to establish an SSH session to that jump host, and the diagram below provides a visual of how this hangs together.

#### SSH Session
So our first step will be to SSH into the jump host. Details will be provided by the instructor providing the command to run and the required password.

It will look similar to this: **ssh student01@3.104.30...**
