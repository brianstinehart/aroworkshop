The `rating-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `rating-api`. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-web` on GitHub: <https://github.com/adriangigante/rating-web>
- The container exposes port 8080
- The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-web`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

{% collapsible %}

We'll now deploy the `rating-web` app. **Don't miss the entry in the following command where we need you to add your GitHub username**.

```sh
oc new-app https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/rating-web --strategy=source
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `API` environment variable for `rating-web` Deployment. The value of this variable is going to be the hostname/port of the `rating-api` service.

Instead of setting the environment variable through the web console, we'll set it through the OpenShift CLI.

```sh
oc set env deploy/rating-web API=http://rating-api:8080
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Expose the `rating-web` service using a Route

{% collapsible %}

Expose the service.

```sh
oc expose svc/rating-web
```

Find out the created route hostname

```sh
oc get route rating-web
```

You should get a response similar to the below.

![Retrieve the created route](media/oc-get-route.png)

Notice the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is comprised of the application name and project name by default. The remainder of the FQDN, the subdomain, is your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster specific apps subdomain.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Try the service

{% collapsible %}

Open the hostname in your browser, you should see the rating app page. Play around, submit a few votes and check the leaderboard.

### Setup GitHub webhook

To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHib repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

{% collapsible %}

As before, the fastest way in through the web console navigating to **Builds -> Build Configs** and selecting **rating-web**, then using the copy option for the GitHub webhook URL near the bottom of the page. You’ll once again use this copied URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

![Rating Web GitHub webhook URL](media/rating-web-github-webhook-url-console.png)

The process at the command line is also the same as before. Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret you'll need need in the GitHub webhook URL using the command below:

```sh
oc get bc/rating-web -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'
```

You'll get back something similar to the below. Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

![Rating Web GitHub trigger secret](media/rating-web-github-secret.png)

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.

```sh
oc describe bc/rating-web
```

![Rating Web GitHub trigger url](media/rating-web-github-webhook-url.png)

Replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step to have a URL similar to `https://api.qv4g35sq.westeurope.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop01/buildconfigs/rating-web/webhooks/VZJewR0m1E65dBAv1IYM/github`. You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

In your GitHub repository (e.g. https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/rating-web), navigate to **Settings -> Webhooks** and select **Add Webhook**.

Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the Payload URL field.

Change the Content Type from GitHub’s default **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** to **application/json**.

Click **Add webhook**.

![GitHub add webhook](media/rating-web-github-addwebhook.png)

If you click back into the newly created webhook, you should see a message from at the bottom with a green tick under **Recent Deliveries**.

Now whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository a new build will automatically start in OpenShift. After a successful build, a new deployment will be triggered as well.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Make a change to the website app and see the rolling update

{% collapsible %}

Go to the `https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/rating-web/blob/master/src/App.vue` file in your repository on GitHub.

Edit the file, and change the `background-color: #999;` line to be `background-color: #0071c5`.

Commit the changes to the file into the `master` branch.

![GitHub edit app](media/rating-web-editcolor.png)

Immediately head to the **Builds** screen in the web console. You'll see a new build queued up which was triggered by the push. Once this is done, it will trigger a new deployment that you can track in the **Workloads -> Deployments** screen. Once this completes by creating a new pod, you should see the new website color updated.
